A proper image metric shall provide a quantitative score suitable to order restored images. This score must reflect the perception by an expert of the fidelity of the images with a given ground truth or reference image. The score shall be insensitive to changes that may be considered as irrelevant for the considered context. For example, image quality indices widely used in the signal processing community are insensitive to an affine transform of the pixel values. For optical interferometry, the pixel size and the field of view of a restored image are, to some extend, free parameters and may thus be different from the pixel size of the ground truth image. Moreover, when only power spectrum and phase closure data (vis2data and t3phi in OI_VIS2 and OI_T3 data-blocks of OI-FITS files) are used to reconstruct an image, the position of the object in the field of view is not constrained by the data and the image metric should not depend on this position.","category":"page"},{"location":"general/","page":"General image metrics","title":"General image metrics","text":"Accounting for all these remarks, a possible definition of the distance between Vy, a reference image, and Vx, a reconstructed image, is given by:","category":"page"},{"location":"general/","page":"General image metrics","title":"General image metrics","text":"beginalign\nDist(VxVy) = min_αβVt Bigl\n  sum_i in MR_boldsymbolθcdotVx cap Vy\n  dleft(α(MR_boldsymbolθcdotVx)_i + β y_iright)\n  notag\n  + sum_i in MR_boldsymbolθcdotVx backslash\n  (MR_boldsymbolθcdotVx cap Vy)\n  dleft(α(MR_boldsymbolθcdotVx)_i + β v_mathrmoutright)\n  notag\n  + sum_i in Vy backslash\n  (MR_boldsymbolθcdotVx cap Vy)\n  dleft(v_mathrmouty_iright)\nBigr\nendalign","category":"page"},{"location":"general/","page":"General image metrics","title":"General image metrics","text":"where d(xy) is some pixel-wise distance, MR_boldsymbolθ is a linear operator which implements resampling with a given magnification, translation, and blurring, and v_mathrmout is the assumed out-of-field pixel value. boldsymbolθ accounts for all parameters defining the operator MR_boldsymbolθ, in particular the translation Vt, and Vy denotes the list of pixels of the image Vy.
