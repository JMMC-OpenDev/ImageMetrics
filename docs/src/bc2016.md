# The 2016' Interferometric Beauty Contest

For the _2016' Interferometric Imaging Beauty Contest_[^Sanchez2016] held in Edinburgh,
the objective of the contest was to reconstruct multi-wavelength images. A metric was thus
specifically designed to compare multi-channel images so as to be insensitive to
irrelevant differences due to:

* **orientation**: image axes may be inverted, notably the E-W axis;
* **translation**: there may be an arbitrary shift between images (possibly a different
  shift in every spectral channel);
* **pixel size**: the size of the pixels used for the restored image is arbitrary even
  though it should be sufficiently small to account for the highest measured frequencies;
* **brightness**: not all entries are normalized according to the channel-wise flux given
  in `OI_FLUX` data-block;
* **out-of-field values**: after all geometric transformations, the fields of view of the
  reference and reconstructed images may be different, it is assumed that missing pixel
  values are equal to zero. This rationale leads to impose that ``β = 0`` and ``η = 0``.

In addition, the comparison must take into account that the measurements have limited
angular resolution. Thus the reference image ``\Vy_λ`` in spectral channel ``λ`` is the
ground truth image ``\Vz_λ`` convolved with an effective _Point Spread Function_ (PSF)
whose _Full Width at Half Maximum_ (FWHM) is ``\omega_{\mathrm{ref}}`` chosen to match the
interferometric resolution:

```math
\Vy_λ = \MR_{\Vtheta^{\mathrm{ref}}_λ}\cdot\Vz_λ
```

with ``\MR_{\Vtheta^{\mathrm{ref}}_λ}`` the linear operator used to resample images for
measuring image distances but with parameters:

```math
\Vtheta^{\mathrm{ref}}_λ = \{
  \rho_{\mathrm{ref}} = 1,
  \Vt_{\mathrm{ref}} = \Zero,
  \omega_λ = λ/(2\,B_{\mathrm{max}})
\}
```

With ``\rho_{\mathrm{ref}} = 1``, it is assumed that there is no translation between the
ground truth images ``\Vz_λ`` and the reference images ``\Vy_λ``, with
``\rho_{\mathrm{ref}} = 1``, the pixel size (3 mas/pixel) is kept the same, and
``\omega_λ = λ/(2\,B_{\mathrm{max}})`` is the FWHM of the interferometric
resolution at wavelength ``λ`` and maximal (projected) baseline ``B_{\mathrm{max}}``.

Since ``\Gamma(η) = \Gamma(0) = 0`` and ``\Gamma(\alpha\,x) = \Gamma(\alpha)\,\Gamma(x)``
(whatever ``x`` and ``\alpha``), the distance between the restored and the reference
images in a given spectral channel can be written as:

``` math
\Dist_{\Gamma,p}(\Vx_λ,\Vy_λ) = \min_{\tilde{α}_λ,\Vt_λ}
  \sum\limits_{j \in Ω_λ}
  \left|
    \tilde{\alpha}_λ\,[\tilde{\Vx}_λ]_{j}
    - [\tilde{\Vy}_λ]_j
  \right|^p
```

where ``Ω_λ = |\MR_{\Vtheta_λ}\cdot\Vx_λ| \cup |\Vy_λ|`` is the union of the fields of
view of ``\MR_{\Vtheta_λ}\cdot\Vx_λ`` and ``\Vy_λ``, and with ``\tilde{α}_λ =
\Gamma(\alpha_λ)``,

``` math
\left[\tilde{\Vy}_λ\right]_j = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
  \Gamma\bigl(\bigl[\Vy_λ\bigr]_j\bigr) & \text{if }j \in |\Vy_λ|\\
  \Gamma(η) = 0 & \text{else}
\end{array}\right,
```

the _brightness corrected extrapolated reference image_, and:

``` math
\left[\tilde{\Vx}_λ\right]_j = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
  \Gamma\bigl(\bigl[\MR_{\Vtheta_λ}\cdot\Vx_λ\bigr]_j\bigr)
  & \text{if }j \in |\MR_{\Vtheta_λ}\cdot\Vx_λ|\\
  \Gamma(η) = 0 & \text{else}
\end{array}\right.
```

where

```math
\Vtheta_λ = \{\rho_λ,\Vt_λ,\omega_λ\}
```

are the settings for resampling the restored image in spectral channel ``λ``. The
magnification ``\rho_λ`` is computed as the ratio of the known pixel sizes of ``\Vx_λ``
and ``\Vy_λ`` and, usually, does not depend on ``λ``.

For the _2016' Interferometric Imaging Beauty Contest_[^Sanchez2016], ``γ = 0.7`` and ``p
= 2`` were the metric parameters chosen for the brightness correction function. When ``p =
2``, minimizing the distance with respect to ``\tilde{α}_λ`` has the following closed-form
solution:

```math
\tilde{α}_λ = \Gamma(α_λ) = \frac{
  \sum_{j \in Ω_λ} [\tilde{\Vx}_λ]_j\,[\tilde{\Vy}_λ]_j
}{
  \sum_{j \in Ω_λ}
  \left([\tilde{\Vx}_λ]_j\right)^2
}
```

and the distance (for ``p = 2``) simplifies to:

```math
\Dist_{\Gamma,2}(\Vx_λ,\Vy_λ) =
  \sum_{j \in |\tilde{\Vy}_λ|} \left([\tilde{\Vy}_λ]_j\right)^2
  - \max_{\Vt_λ} \frac{
    \left(
        \sum_{j \in Ω_λ} [\tilde{\Vx}_λ]_{j}\,[\tilde{\Vy}_λ]_j
    \right)^2
  }{
    \sum_{j \in Ω_λ} \left([\tilde{\Vx}_λ]_{j}\right)^2
  }
```

and the score is:

```math
\begin{align}
\Score_{\Gamma,2}(\Vx_λ)
  = 1 - \frac{
    \Dist_{\Gamma,2}(\Vx_λ,\Vy_λ)
  }{
    \sum_{j \in |\tilde{\Vy}_λ|} \left([\tilde{\Vy}_λ]_j\right)^2
  }
  &= \max_{\Vt_λ} \frac{
    \left(
        \sum_{j \in Ω_λ} [\tilde{\Vx}_λ]_{j}\,[\tilde{\Vy}_λ]_j
    \right)^2
  }{
    \left(\sum_{j \in Ω_λ} \left([\tilde{\Vx}_λ]_{j}\right)^2\right)\,
    \left(\sum_{j \in Ω_λ} \left([\tilde{\Vy}_λ]_j\right)^2\right)
  }\notag\\
  &= \frac{
    \max\limits_{\Vt_λ} \left(
        \sum_{j \in Ω_λ} [\tilde{\Vx}_λ]_{j}\,[\tilde{\Vy}_λ]_j
    \right)^2
  }{
    \left(\sum_{j \in |\MR_{\Vtheta_λ}\cdot\Vx_λ|} \left([\tilde{\Vx}_λ]_{j}\right)^2\right)\,
    \left(\sum_{j \in |\Vy_λ|} \left([\tilde{\Vy}_λ]_j\right)^2\right)
  }\notag
\end{align}
```

The score for a multi-spectral image ``\Vx`` is the sum of the scores in all spectral channels:

``` math
\Score_{\Gamma,p}(\Vx) = \sum_λ \Score_{\Gamma,p}(\Vx_λ).
